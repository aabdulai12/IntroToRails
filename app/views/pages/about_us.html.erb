  <h2>Integration between the "Dogs" and "Breeds" tables using CSV:</h2>
<p>
  The "Dogs" table has a foreign key column named "breed_id" that references the "id" column in the "Breeds" table.<br>
  This relationship allows each dog to be associated with a specific breed.<br>
  By leveraging the data from the "dog_breeds.csv" file, you can populate the "Breeds" table with information about different dog breeds.<br>
  The "breed_id" column in the "Dogs" table serves as a reference to the corresponding breed in the "Breeds" table.<br>
  With this integration, it can access detailed information about the breed of each dog, such as the breed's name, group, section, country of origin, URL, image, and PDF files.
</p>

<h2>Integration between the "Dogs" and "Owners" tables using Faker:</h2>
<p>
  The "Dogs" table has a foreign key column named "owner_id" that references the "id" column in the "Owners" table.<br>
  This relationship allows each dog to be associated with a specific owner.<br>
  By using Faker to generate synthetic data for owners and dogs, you can populate the "Owners" table with information about owners, including their names and email addresses.<br>
  The "owner_id" column in the "Dogs" table serves as a reference to the corresponding owner in the "Owners" table.<br>
  With this integration, it can showcase the owners of each dog and display their information on the "About Us" page.
</p>

<h2>Integration between the "VetVisits" and "Dogs" tables:</h2>
<p>
  The "VetVisits" table has a foreign key column named "dog_id" that references the "id" column in the "Dogs" table.<br>
  This relationship allows each vet visit to be associated with a specific dog.<br>
  By using Faker to generate synthetic data for vet visits, you can populate the "VetVisits" table with information about the visit date and description.<br>
  The "dog_id" column in the "VetVisits" table serves as a reference to the corresponding dog in the "Dogs" table.<br>
  With this integration, it can display vet visit records on the "About Us" page, showing the visit date and description for each dog.
